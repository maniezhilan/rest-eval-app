  "readme": "\nag-Grid\n==============\n\n\"ag\" stands for AGnostic\n\n#### Install with Bower\n```sh\n$ bower install ag-grid\n```\n\n#### Install with Npm\n```sh\n$ npm install ag-grid\n```\n\nSee the [www.ag-grid.com](http://www.ag-grid.com) for overview and documentation.\n\n\nBuilding\n==============\n\nTo build:\n- `npm install`\n- `npm install gulp -g`\n- `bower install`\n- `gulp` or `gulp release`\n\nDefault gulp task is for development. It includes source maps, does not include minification, and starts a watch.\n\n'release' gulp task does minification and no source maps. This is for releasing.\n\nFolder Structure\n==============\nThe new build has the following structure:\n- **\\src** -> contains source files (TypeScript and CSS), don't touch these!\n- **\\dist** -> contains distribution files\n- **\\dist\\ag-grid.js and \\dist\\ag-grid.min.js** -> use these if not using a package manager and put ag-Grid on\nthe global scope. The new JavaScript distribution files contain the CSS for the grid, no need to reference\nseparately.\n- **\\dist\\styles** -> contains CSS files, used if doing your own bundling.\n- **\\dist\\lib** -> contains compiles JavaScript files in CommonJS format.\n- **\\main.js** -> CommonJS root file, reference this file if importing project via CommonJS.\n- **\\main.d.ts** -> CommonJS root definition file.\n\n\nAsking Questions\n==============\n\nPlease do not use GitHub issues to ask questions. Ask questions on the\n[website forum](http://www.ag-grid.com/forum).\n\n\nContributing\n==============\n\nag-Grid is not looking for contributors. It is not intended to be developed by an online community.\nHowever suggestion on change and raising bugs are appreciated.\n\nIf you are doing a Pull Request:\n- Make your code changes in `src/` files only, don't update dist files\n- Discard all changes to `dist/`\n- Create Pull Request\n\nFor large changes:\n- Make your doc changes in project [ag-grid-docs](https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-docs), a feature is not complete unless it's documented!\n- Do manual end to end testing off all examples in documentation\n\nPR's on new features **are not** generally accepted. \n\nPR's on small bug fixes **are** generally accepted.\n\nIf a PR for a large request is submitted, the typical action is the author will take influence from the\ncode to implement the feature, either in ag-grid or [ag-grid-enterprise](https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid-enterprise).",
